Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Assignment

This is a peer-graded assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data in Coursera

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:-

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

About my R script

This file containing the R Script does the following steps in order to create a tidy dataset:-

    Download the zip file
    Unzip and extract the files
    Assign all data frames
    Assigning Column names for the datas
    Let's merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
